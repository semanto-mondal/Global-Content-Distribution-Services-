## A Study on Different Parameters Affecting Overall Cost of Global Content Distribution Services in Metropolitan Cloud Network 

Due to the advancement of technology and the internet, every digital component is connected which results in a tremendous increase in digital content. Global Content Distribution Networks are used to make digital content and multimedia content available to potentially large and geographically distributed consumer populations. In the era of cloud, several cloud providers provide cloud services to their users by optimizing cloud-based content delivery. There are different factors associated with a cost-effective model such as content delivery cost, computation cost, and storage cost associated with the cloud network. In this study, we have tried to analyze different parameters that can affect the overall cost and performance of different Global Content Distribution services such as the capacity of resource blocks and, the addition of edge computing by applying different network constraints such as flow conservation constraints, flow chaining constraints, communication and computation capacity constraints, maximum delay constraints. We have also tried to experiment with the effect of different network infrastructures on the overall cost of four different Content Distribution services for different service graphs.
