## A Study on Different Parameters Affecting Overall Cost of Global Content Distribution Services in Metropolitan Cloud Network 


# Project Brief
Due to the advancement of technology and the internet, every digital component is connected which results in a tremendous increase in digital content. Global Content Distribution Networks are used to make digital content and multimedia content available to potentially large and geographically distributed consumer populations. In the era of cloud, several cloud providers provide cloud services to their users by optimizing cloud-based content delivery. There are different factors associated with a cost-effective model such as content delivery cost, computation cost, and storage cost associated with the cloud network. In this study, we have tried to analyze different parameters that can affect the overall cost and performance of different Global Content Distribution services such as the capacity of resource blocks and, the addition of edge computing by applying different network constraints such as flow conservation constraints, flow chaining constraints, communication and computation capacity constraints, maximum delay constraints. We have also tried to experiment with the effect of different network infrastructures on the overall cost of four different Content Distribution services for different service graphs.  

# Keywords: Global Content Distribution Network (GCDN), Edge Computing, Service Graph, Network Optimization.

# Project Objectives
1. The aim is to compare different services with respect to cost
2. To minimize the overall cost by applying overlapping
3. To increase network capacity to reduce the cost 
4. To minimize overall resource usage by increasing network capacity

# Services
1. Professional Video on Demand (e.g.: Netflix)
2. Professional Live Video (e.g.: IPTV)
3. User-generated video on Demand (e.g.: Facebook)
4. User-generated Live Video (e.g.: Facebook Live)

# Result & Conclusion
As the utilization of resources increases the overall delivery cost also increases. An increase in capacity reduces the usage of resources hence reducing the overall costs whereas an increase in rate for constant resource capacity linearly increases the cost. Overlapping reduces the use of links, which reduces the overall usage of resources as a result of overall cost reductions but to achieve this the capacity of resources should be large enough based on the requirements. Adding a computation node at the access layer reduces the overall cost for a larger network. The work focuses on a single metropolitan area which can be extended to multiple metropolitan areas using the same optimization concepts in future work.
